## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
```
current version of NVM
Node 20.14.0
Ruby Version 3.3.3
SQLite 3
```

## Node Version Management

This project uses nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions. The `.nvmrc` file is 
configured to use Node version 20.14.0.

When running locally, you will need to set the node version with `nvm use` as described below under "Installation".  
For deployment, the `.nvmrc` file will be used to set the node version and the deployment script will automatically
use the correct version.

## Installing
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/uclibs/aaec.git ./path/to/local`
1. Change to the application's directory: e.g. `cd ./path/to/local`
1. Make sure you are on the qa branch: `git checkout qa`
1. Install the node version listed in .nvmrc: `nvm install`
1. Direct to the correct node version listed in .nvmrc: `nvm use`
1. Install bundler (if needed): `gem install bundler`
1. Run bundler: `bundle install`
1. Run the database migrations: `bundle exec rails db:migrate`
1. To include the colleges at UC, seed the database: `bundle exec rails db:seed`
1. Start the rails server: `bundle exec rails server`
1. Visit the site at [http://localhost:3000] (http://localhost:3000)

## Running the tests
1. Run the database migrations if you haven't already: ```bundle exec rails db:migrate```
1. Run the test suite: ```bundle exec rspec```

## Note on Dependency Management
While this repository includes a yarn.lock file, you do not need to run yarn install to use the program. 
The application is fully operational with bundle install alone, which manages all necessary Ruby 
dependencies.
